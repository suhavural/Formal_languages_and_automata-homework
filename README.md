 A dynamic console application

1. When the application runs, it must first read the file named "FST.txt". The "FST.txt" file contains an FST
It is useful to test your application by creating different files that conform to the format.

2. The example file is separated by a space and tab character. The values in the transition function Î´ are separated by tab
separated by a character. A screenshot of an example file is shown below.

3. Number of states, names of states, number of symbols in the input alphabet and output alphabet and symbols
can change. So your application should be dynamic to support them.

4. After the program reads the file, it should ask the user to enter 2 inputs and the
write the outputs of the FST according to the inputs and the order of the states passed while processing the input.

5. Consider the object-oriented programming technique while doing your project. Therefore, in your project
a certain number and appropriate number of classes and methods should be defined.
